      "<p>Lambeth’s Department for Architecture and Planning investigated system building very early on, as is shown by a report by William Jacoby following a visit to Germany with representatives of Bernard Sunley and Sons, the building contractors holding the license for Alletong in Britain. Taking advantage of the government’s subsidies for high-rise housing construction, Lambeth embarked on building 7 pentagonal towers and 8 point blocks with prefabrication factories installed on site.</p>"
