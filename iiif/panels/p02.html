      Lambeth’s Department for Architecture and Planning investigated system
      building very early on, as is shown by a report by William Jacoby
      following a visit to Germany with representatives of Bernard Sunley and
      Sons, the building contractors holding the license for Alletong in
      Britain. Taking advantage of the government’s subsidies for high-rise
      housing construction, Lambeth embarked on building 7 pentagonal towers and
      8 point blocks with prefabrication factories installed on site.
