    <h1>Yesterday's Lambeth Today</h1>
    <h2>Public Housing Developments 1965-80</h2>

    <p>
        In the context of the UK’s current affordable housing 
        shortage, many councils are replacing housing stock with new 
        higher-density schemes. Architects are looking back to 
        re-evaluate existing projects. Are there good examples that 
        have stood the test of time?
    </p>

    <p>
        The most recent period of extensive public housing construction 
        is bookended by the 1965 reorganisation of local government 
        and the beginning of the neo-liberal counter-revolution in the 
        late 1970s. Many of its projects are still here; some have been 
        demolished or face the threat of demolition. The geographical 
        focus of this exhibition is Lambeth because during this period 
        Lambeth’s Department for Architecture and Planning, under the 
        leadership of Ted Hollamby, was developing an extensive 
        variety of solutions in their search for high density.
    </p>

    <p>
        Whilst in the 1960s a very positive attitude and trust in new 
        technologies prevailed, the 1970s were marked by the global 
        financial crisis, high inflation and unemployment levels. 
    </p>

    <p>
        In the 1960s the British government subsidised ‘high-rise’ 
        construction, with new residential towers intended to demonstrate 
        the power of the welfare state, examples of which in this 
        exhibition are Lambeth’s pentagon and point blocks.

        Scattered bomb-damaged sites were combined into large 
        development areas, industry was moved, and houses between 
        bought with the aid of Compulsory Purchase Orders (CPOs), 
        all providing space for large estates. Examples of these are the 
        Stockwell Park Estate, Myatt’s Fields (with its state-of-the-art 
        services strategy manifested in the estate boiler house), and the 
        Moorlands Estate, where Southwyck House was built to acoustically 
        protect the residential development from the noise of the 
        Greater London Council’s planned ring motorway, subsequently 
        abandoned.

        The 1960s also saw growing value being given to the 
        refurbishment of existing accommodation and townscapes that people 
        had identified with over generations. The designation of 
        Conservation Areas, General Improvement Areas and Housing Action 
        Areas from the late 1960s onwards indicates this as do many 
        re-habilitation and infill projects. Community activism and 
        community consultation developed in that period, here represented
        by Blenheim Gardens, Clapham Manor, and Central Hill, all examples 
        of Lambeth’s low-rise high-density developments of which 
        Cressingham Gardens and Dunbar Street are also notable.

        The exhibition summarises the body of work investigated for a 
        current University College London, Bartlett School of Architecture, 
        Architectural and Urban History and Theory MPhil/PhD research 
        project by Christiane Felber.

        A big thank you for making this exhibition possible goes to the 
        Lambeth Archives Team, who generously supported the research 
        with great enthusiasm, my supervisors Peter Guillery 
        and Colin Thom at the Bartlett School of Architecture / Survey of 
        London and all who have helped the research so far, in the form 
        of professional advice or volunteer interviewees who worked for 
        Lambeth at the time or live in the estates. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I am looking for further interviewees and for people who know 
        more about the projects and can add to or correct my data. Please 
        do get in touch if you were involved or are living in the Lambeth 
        projects constructed between 1965 and 1980 by emailing
